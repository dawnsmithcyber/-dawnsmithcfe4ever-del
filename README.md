## 👤 About Me
I am a cybersecurity professional with a CFE, currently training and immersed in the **Cybersecurity Community** apprenticeship with Cyber Potential. I specialize in monitoring, detecting, and responding to threats within the digital landscape. My goal is to master the **Technical Controls** that keep organizations resilient against modern adversaries.

## 🛠️ Technical Arsenal Being Added

### **Identity & Network Defense**
* **Firewalls & ACLs:** Configuring rules to enforce the Principle of Least Privilege.
* **MFA & IAM:** Strengthening authentication protocols to prevent unauthorized access.
* **VPN/TLS:** Securing data in transit across untrusted networks.
* **Microsoft Azure With Defender For Cloud Hands On:** Hands-on lab focused on cloud security posture management (CSPM) and workload protection. The project demonstrates how to deploy, configure, and monitor security within the Azure ecosystem to detect threats and remediate vulnerabilities in real-time.


### **Monitoring & Detection (The SOC Toolkit)**
* **SIEM:** Analyzing logs in **Splunk / ELK Stack** to identify "needles in the haystack."
* **IDS/IPS:** Deploying **Snort / Suricata** to detect and block malicious traffic.
* **Endpoint Security:** Implementing **EDR / Sysmon** for granular visibility into host activity.

## 🚀 Featured Cybersecurity Labs

### 📊 Linux Fundamentals Part 1 https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxfundamentalspart1
* **The Goal:** Introduction to the essential commands on an interactive terminal.
* **Controls Used:** Linux
* **Outcome:** Learned commands to interact via terminal.

### 📊 Python Basics https://tryhackme.com/room/pythonbasics?utm_campaign=social_share&utm_medium=social&utm_content=share-completed-room&utm_source=copy&sharerId=697380b71aadacf217fb0a90
* **The Goal:** learn to write code using a code editor.
* **Outcome:** Using a web-based code editor, learn the basics of Python and put your knowledge into practice by eventually coding a short Bitcoin investment project.

### 📊 SOC Fundamentals https://app.letsdefend.io/training/lessons/soc-fundamentals
* **The Goal:** learn SOC Fundamentals
* **Outcome:** During this intensive lab series, I gained hands-on experience in the core workflows of a Security Operations Center (SOC), focusing on the end-to-end lifecycle of incident detection and response. I developed proficiency in log analysis and correlation using industry-standard SIEM platforms, where I practiced triaging alerts, distinguishing true positives from false positives, and mapping attacker behaviors to the MITRE ATT&CK® framework. Through simulated attack scenarios involving malware, phishing, and network intrusions, I strengthened my ability to monitor network traffic via Wireshark, investigate endpoint anomalies, and execute containment strategies. This experience solidified my understanding of the Cyber Kill Chain and equipped me with the technical agility required to defend enterprise environments against evolving threats.

### 📊 Offensive Security Intro https://tryhackme.com/room/offensivesecurityintrokKx12?utm_campaign=social_share&utm_medium=social&utm_content=share-completed-room&utm_source=copy&sharerId=697380b71aadacf217fb0a90
* **The Goal:** The goal was to master the attacker's methodology to identify better, exploit, and remediate vulnerabilities within a secure environment.
* **The Outcome:** I gained hands-on experience with the fundamental stages of an engagement—Information Gathering (Reconnaissance), Enumeration, and Exploitation—using industry-standard tools like Nmap and GoBuster. By successfully identifying vulnerabilities within a target web server and utilizing the Metasploit Framework to gain unauthorized access, I developed a practical understanding of how attackers bypass security controls. This lab reinforced the critical importance of the 'think like a hacker' approach to identify and remediate security gaps before malicious actors can exploit them.

### 📊 Activity Logs: Configured Diagnostic Settings to track both "Service" and "Blob" level metrics. ✅ 

I just completed a hands-on demo setting up Azure Storage Account Logs. I see why this can be a game-changer for visibility. Without access to these logs, an attacker could steal data, and you’d be left in the dark.

Investigative Impact:
* Scope: Targeted an Azure Storage Account used for sensitive financial data.
* Activity Logs: Configured Diagnostic Settings to track both "Service" and "Blob" level metrics.

Here is the reasoning I learned:
This setup allows a SOC Analyst to spot (ATO) Account Takeover or Data Exfiltration in real-time.

Key Takeaway: If you don't log it, you can't investigate it. - Another reminder why digital integrity is so important in an investigation.
